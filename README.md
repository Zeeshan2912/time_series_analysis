# time_series_analysis
# Overview
This project aims to provide tools and techniques for analyzing time series data. Time series analysis involves studying the pattern or behavior of data points collected over time, making it useful for forecasting, anomaly detection, and trend identification in various domains.
# Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and prepare time series data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize time series data to understand underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality.
Modeling Techniques: Implement various time series models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and more, for forecasting and prediction tasks.
Forecasting: Use trained models to make predictions about future data points in a time series.
Anomaly Detection: Identify abnormal patterns or outliers in time series data.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Statsmodels
scikit-learn
TensorFlow (for deep learning-based models)
Prophet (for Facebook Prophet model)
# Setup Instructions
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/time-series-analysis.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Organize your time series data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
Use provided scripts or develop your own to preprocess and analyze the time series data.
Experiment with different models and techniques for forecasting, anomaly detection, etc.
# Usage
Load your time series data into the analysis environment.
Follow provided notebooks or scripts to preprocess the data, perform EDA, and apply various modeling techniques.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error).
Use trained models for forecasting future data points or detecting anomalies in real-time data streams.
Experiment with hyperparameters and model configurations to improve performance.
